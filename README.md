# CODEX Pipeline

This repository contains everything necessary to process image data, from focus stacking to basic analysis.

## Repo Contents

### focus stack

- `requirements-fstack.txt`: List of requirements to run fstack and fstack_cu. Activate your conda environment and run `pip install -r requirements-fstack.txt`
- fstack
  - `__init__.py`: this is the fstack code.
  - Python code in the pipeline/ directory can import fstack with `from fstack import fstack`
- fstack_cu
  - `__init__.py`: this is the CUDA-accelerated fstack code.
  - Python code in the pipeline/ directory can import fstack with `from fstack_cu import fstack_cu` or `from fstack_cu import fstack_cu_images`
- `fstacker.py`: perform a focus stack using local (provide path) or remote (using GCSFS) images. This code assumes the existence of an `index.csv` file in the source directory containing cycle names.

### segmentation

- `requirements-segment.txt`: see `requirements-fstack.txt` description
- `segmenter.py`: segment nuclei using cellpose using a pretrained model. Use the cellpose gui to create the model. `segmenter.py` assumes a folder and file structure created by `fstacker.py`.

### analysis

- `requirements-analyze.txt`: see `requirements-fstack.txt` description
- `analyzer.py`: measure the size and average brightness of each cell in each channel and save as a csv. `analyzer.py` assumes a folder and file structure created by `segmenter.py`.

## Guides

### fstacker usage

1. to use fstacker as a script, set `CLI = TRUE` in `main()` in `fstacker.py` and set the constants. Then, run the file
2. to use the command line interface, set `CLI = TRUE` in `main()` in `fstacker.py`. Navigate to the directory `fstacker.py` is in, activate the conda environment if necessary, and run `python -m fstacker --help` to see all the flags and how to set them

### segmenter usage

if you are having trouble installing cellpose, try uninstalling all other python packages that use QTpy (e.g. cv2), install cellpose, then reinstall everthing you uninstalled.

1. to use segmenter as a script, set the constants and run the file. Note that it takes a pretrained model as a parameter; you can change it to one of the built-in pretrained models or set a path to a custom pretrained model
2. cellpose already has a CLI; `segmenter.py` itself does not have a CLI

### analyzer usage

1. to use analyzer as a script, set the constants and run the file
2. there currently is no CLI version
